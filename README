				        mod_fortress
                    			Apache
			      Application Level Firewall 
					          and
			      Intrusion Detection System



	mod_fortress is an HTTP application firewall and intrusion detection
 system, it relies on analysing requests sent from the client to the
 webserver, and logs specific malicious requests with extensive info about
 the attacker as well as the attacked server(if multiple virtual
 servers). It also has the ability to act as a non-transparent proxy,
 thus, protecting/obscuring your server via sending false return HTTP
 error codes. 



FEATURES:

  * Detects and Logs common known cgi/http security requests and scans

  * SSL support
  
  * Detects all known(and hopefully unknown) Anti-IDS Evasive Scaning methods
   (Whisker, twwwscan, VoidEye...etc)

  * "Fortress In the Middle": Ability to act as a non-transparent proxy
    to modify HTTP return error codes.
  
  * Custom logging option via a changeable format string.

  * Supports Apache 1.3/2.0

   2- RUN_FORTRESS_IN_THE_MIDDLE	enables the non-transparent proxy
							
   3- RUN_LOGGER			enables the IDS logger


INSTALLATION:

    just type 'make'

NON TRANSPARENT PROXY CODE:

	Appended to each signature line is a tag like [xxx], this stands for 
 the fake HTTP error code to return. If fortress in the middle was enabled, the 
 number between the [] is returned as an HTTP error code (eg: 404, 403, 200), [0]
 returns whatever Apache would return if there was no non-transparent proxy.
